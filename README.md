#### This is a CRUD To-Do list web application which I have created using Play framework. The reason for this project is to help me get a better understanding of Play Framework and MVC architecture in general

Current features:
* To-do list items can be created
* To-do list items can be as either marked as completed or uncompleted, if an item is marked as completed then it will be striked out

Features I will add:
* Add To-do list item catergoies, e.g. a housework category would have items such as 'do laundry'
* Allow list items to be deleted
* Allow list items to be edited
* Store the created date for each item
